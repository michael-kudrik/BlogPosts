# Film Review: A Scene at the Sea

Tonight I watched a Japanese live-action movie with a close buddy of mine. He recently released his[ own blog](https://www.ericbuecklers.studio/blog) so feel free to check it out. Before I get into the nitty gritty of my review I will give a brief synopsis. 

The movie directed by Takeshi Kitano flows peacefully with very little spoken dialogue, and a focus on storytelling. It follows our main character Shigeru who works as a garbage collector and is deaf. He stumbles upon a surfboard on one of his garbage runs and becomes destined to take up surfing.

## **Warning Spoilers Ahead!**

The movie starts off with Shigeru carrying on with his daily garbage collection routine. He stops and sees a surfboard with a damaged nose. He hesitates and decides to ignore it, only to stop a couple hundred feet down the street to run back and grab it. He brings it back to his home where he works hard to patch it up to the best of his abilities. Shigeru is eager to get in the water at this point.

It is also at this time that we are introduced to his also deaf girlfriend. The two of them share a special relationship, devoid of almost all communication. They instead rely on an innate sense of understanding of one another.

Created in 1993 by Toyoda Masashi, this useless but funny command is a play on the `ls` command used in terminals. It creates a visual of a steam locomotive (hence the name SL) every time it is typed.

If you were on the internet from the 90s to the early 2000s you will remember how google search used to give straight up results. Nowadays the internet is focused on SEO and running advertisements, as opposed to finding the best information. Many of the websites nowadays look all too familiar, focusing on garnering clicks to contribute to their advertisement revenue. This post talks about how we go to this point, and the major names behind it.

  

### The World Depends On Old Code

[https://www.pcmag.com/articles/ibms-plan-to-update-cobol-with-watson](https://www.pcmag.com/articles/ibms-plan-to-update-cobol-with-watson)

  

This article talks about how a large portion of the worlds business and banking systems run off of the programming language COBOL. Since the language is so old, many of the programmers are exiting the workforce. This is making large code-bases written in COBOL hard to maintain, since there are not many new engineers learning the language. The article goes on to talk about how IBM may be using AI to help solve the problem.
