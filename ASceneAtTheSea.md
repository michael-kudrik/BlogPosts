# Film Review: A Scene at the Sea

Tonight I watched a Japanese live-action movie with a close buddy of mine. He recently released his[ own blog](https://www.ericbuecklers.studio/blog) so feel free to check it out. Before I get into the nitty gritty of my review I will give a brief synopsis. 

The movie directed by Takeshi Kitano flows peacefully with very little spoken dialogue, and a focus on storytelling. It follows our main character Shigeru who works as a garbage collector and is deaf. He stumbles upon a surfboard on one of his garbage runs and becomes destined to take up surfing.

## **Warning Spoilers Ahead!**

The movie starts off with Shigeru carrying on with his daily garbage collection routine. He stops and sees a surfboard with a damaged nose. He hesitates and decides to ignore it, only to stop a couple hundred feet down the street to run back and grab it. He brings it back to his home where he works hard to patch it up to the best of his abilities. Shigeru is eager to get in the water at this point.

It is also at this time that we are introduced to his also deaf girlfriend. The two of them share a special relationship, devoid of almost all communication. They instead rely on an innate sense of understanding of one another.

Eventually the board breaks and Shigeru buys himself a brand new high performance surfboard (Pretty awesome, right?) .  He continues to practice and eventually attracts the eye of the surf shop owner who gifts him an old wetsuit, and encourages him to go to a surf competition. 

He arrives at the competition yet misses his name being called for his heat. Nevertheless, Shigeru continues to surf, perhaps in a hope to fill the holes in his stale and silent life. It's this passion that he starts to hold dearly, and eventually improves upon that drives him in his day to day life.

The cinematography compliments the story and does not hold back in the slightest when it comes to long and static shots showcasing the vivid color and seascape. Most of the shots entail one character observing the other from afar, something I haven't quite seen much of in other films. It is although the characters are pondering into the detached reality of the others life. 

Shigeru returns to the surf contest and this time makes it out into the water where he preforms well enough to land him a trophy among his group. This point of the film is the climax of Shigeru's hard work, and we can see that in the pictures he takes
